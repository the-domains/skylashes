# Artwork and stories by Skylar McClellan

Hi there! I'm an writer and illustrator of children's stories, young adult fiction, and concept artist for various styles and mediums. Though I mostly work on my own ideas, I'm always open to collaborations, and I'm ALWAYS willing to talk about and critique anything creative.

Thanks for stopping by!
